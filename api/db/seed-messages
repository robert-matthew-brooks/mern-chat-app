1_0_Hey nice chat app :)
0_1_Thanks!
1_0_I just don't want to break anything by deleting stuff from your backend database...
0_1_Don't worry - when the app hasn't been interacted with for 10 minutes, the test account data re-seeds itself.
0_1_So you can play around with deleting, posting... it will all get re-seeded shortly :)
1_0_What about accounts and messages that aren't test users?
0_1_That won't be deleted :)
1_0_Cool thanks!

2_0_So are there multiple accounts on this app?
0_2_Yes - you can register a new account, or check out some of the other test accounts.
2_0_Other test accounts? Like mine?
2_0_How do I do that?
0_2_All the test accounts have the same password. So anyone wanting to check this app out can use your username and my password to login.
2_0_So they can see this conversation from my perspective?
0_2_Yes. Also, if you log in with another account using another browser, you can send messages in real time.
0_2_You can also see the online status of everyone in your friends list.
2_0_Cool!
